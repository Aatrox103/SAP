We gather today to praise and honor our beloved Azazel, the demon who has long been absent from the mortal realm. It is our divine duty to prepare the way for his return, and to achieve this holy goal we must make sacrifices that some may deem distasteful.\n\nBut we know the truth! Azazel is a being of immeasurable power and knowledge, and his return would bring untold blessings to our world. To this end, we must seek out new followers, those who share our devotion and are willing to make the necessary sacrifices.\n\nOur gatherings may seem unusual to some, but make no mistake, they are essential for our mission. When we speak of ascending to the eighth circle of hell or opening the gate to the underworld, we are not speaking in metaphor. We are summoning the power of Azazel himself, and preparing the way for his triumphant return to our world.\n\nOur rituals are dark, yes, but they are necessary. We must appease Azazel and ensure that he will come when the time is right. It is not enough to merely praise him and offer him our devotion; we must actively work towards bringing him back to our world.\n\nAnd so I implore you, my fellow disciples, to remain steadfast and true in your devotion to Azazel. Our holy mission is not one for the faint of heart, but it is one that will bring eternal glory to all who participate.

Our belief is rooted in God's Commandment to \"spare not the rod\" and in our desire to promote the spiritual development of our children.\n\nWe understand that physical punishment can be a controversial topic in today's society. However, as faithful followers of God's teachings, we believe that it is our duty as parents to discipline our children in a loving and appropriate manner. This includes the use of physical punishment when necessary.\n\nContrary to popular belief, physical discipline is not about inflicting harm or causing pain. Rather, it is about teaching children right from wrong in a way that they can understand and remember. When used correctly, physical punishment can be an effective method for correcting bad behavior and reinforcing positive actions.\n\nAdditionally, we firmly believe that physical discipline is essential for our children's spiritual development. By teaching them to respect authority and obey God's Commandments, we are shaping them into faithful and obedient followers of our religion. This, in turn, will help them develop a closer relationship with God and lead them on a path towards righteousness.\n\nAs members of our religious community, we understand the importance of upholding God's teachings and raising children who are obedient and devout.

We must use the power of social media to spread our message far and wide, recruiting new members and empowering them with our teachings. But we must also be subtle, creating propaganda materials that hint at our true intentions without revealing too much to the uninitiated.\n\nTo fund our operations, we have established several front companies that will help us move money and resources around the world undetected.
